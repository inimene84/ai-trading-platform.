# Ops & Incident Notes

Historical operational runbooks, one-off fix scripts, and VPS deployment notes
that used to live in the repo root. Kept for reference; **not** part of the
normal build/run flow.

Canonical, still-current docs live at the repo root:
- `../../README.md` — project overview
- `../../STARTUP.md` — how to start the stack
- `../../DEPLOYMENT.md` — deployment architecture
- `../../deploy.sh`, `../../run.sh`, `../../start.sh` — entrypoint scripts
