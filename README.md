## Overview

**QuantumTrade Pro** is an institutional-grade algorithmic trading and risk execution system designed for continuous 24/7 autonomous operation across **Binance Futures** (crypto perpetuals) and **cTrader** (institutional FX and metals).

Evolving beyond simple rule-based bots or conversational agent experiments, the platform implements a **rigorous quantitative pipeline**:
- **Execution Architecture**: Non-blocking asynchronous event loop with serialized per-symbol execution locks and GTX maker order routing.
- **Fail-Closed Safety**: Double-locked live deployment authorization, rolling drawdown halts, exchange clamp validation, and strict book partitioning (`broker + account_id + mode`).
- **Uncertainty-Gated Machine Learning**: LightGBM meta-labeling trained on Triple-Barrier events with purged cross-validation, sample uniqueness weighting, and a probability-margin + entropy uncertainty gate.
- **Cognitive Memory Layer**: Stratified FINMEM vector memory in Qdrant across shallow (14d), intermediate (90d), and deep (365d) reflection horizons.

## Butterfly Architecture Map

The system is organized into a balanced, symmetric **Butterfly Architecture**:
- **Left Wing (Intelligent Signal & Ingestion)**: Alternative news feeds, sentiment analysis, Qdrant vector retrieval, FINMEM stratified memory, Kronos time-series forecasting, and Jesse ML meta-models.
- **Central Core (Fail-Closed Risk & Execution Hub)**: Dual-mode session routing, rolling-peak drawdown gates, directional exposure caps, min-edge fee filters, and affirmative live guards.
- **Right Wing (Multi-Broker Execution & Active Management)**: GTX maker routing on Binance, FIX/OpenAPI dispatch on cTrader, dynamic ATR trailing stops, and startup exchange SL/TP restoration.

## Institutional Quant Stack

The platform embeds financial machine learning practices inspired by Marcos López de Prado:

### 1. Robust Validation Metrics
- **Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR)**: Corrects for selection bias under multiple testing, non-normal return distributions (skewness/kurtosis), and track-record length ($DSR > 0.95$ threshold required for deployment).
- **Combinatorially Symmetric Cross-Validation (CSCV)**: Evaluates the Probability of Backtest Overfitting ($PBO < 0.30$), ensuring strategies do not memorize historical noise.
- **Purged K-Fold with Temporal Embargo**: Eliminates information leakage across non-independent financial observations.

### 2. Triple-Barrier Labeling & Meta-Models
- **Triple Barrier Method**: Signals are labeled using dynamic upper take-profit, lower stop-loss (volatility-adjusted via ATR), and time-out horizontal barriers.
- **Sample Uniqueness Concurrency Weighting**: Overlapping trade windows are down-weighted by inverse concurrency to eliminate label redundancy.
- **Probability-Margin Uncertainty Gating**: The prediction server scores ambiguity as the top-two class probability margin combined with Shannon entropy; ambiguous candidates are vetoed before touching capital. This is a heuristic threshold, not a split-conformal bound — there is no calibration set and no $\alpha$, so it must not be read as a calibrated error rate.
- **Fractional Kelly Sizing**: Allocations scale proportionally to model edge and uncertainty while strictly capping max directional exposure.

### 3. FINMEM Stratified Vector Memory
- **Stratified Storage in Qdrant**:
  - *Shallow Tier* ($Q=14$ days, decay factor $\alpha=0.900$): Tracks high-frequency market regimes and short-term volatility shocks.
  - *Intermediate Tier* ($Q=90$ days, decay factor $\alpha=0.967$): Captures quarterly macro rotations, central bank cycles, and earnings seasons.
  - *Deep Tier* ($Q=365$ days, decay factor $\alpha=0.988$): Retains historical structural extremes, flash crashes, and liquidity regimes.
- **Dynamic Cognitive Persona Switching**: Automatically modulates between *Risk-Seeking* and *Risk-Averse* behavioral profiles depending on market condition consensus and trailing drawdown.

## Fail-Closed Safety Stack

| Safety Layer | Implementation | Fail-Safe Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Live Deploy Double-Lock** | `CONFIRM_LIVE_DEPLOY=true` + `ADMIN_API_KEY` | Refuses process startup if either flag or authentication token is missing. |
| **API Boundary Lockdown** | Constant-time HMAC on all `/trading/*` routes | Blocks unauthorized information dumps of positions, balances, or bot telemetry (401/403). |
| **Image Worker Ceiling** | Dockerfile CMD set to `--workers 1` | Prevents split-brain loops, duplicate pyramid maps, and concurrency collisions. |
| **Fail-Safe Testnet Fallback** | Compose default `${BINANCE_TESTNET:-true}` | If `.env` omits the testnet flag, the platform defaults to simulated execution. |
| **Rolling Peak Drawdown** | Lookback window of 72 hours (configurable) | Halts new entries when equity drops below limit (20%) in live production; safely suppressed during testing/sandbox (`DISABLE_DRAWDOWN_IN_TESTING=true` or sandbox broker). Exits continue running. |
| **Multi-Broker Isolation** | `broker + account_id + mode` partitioning | Paper Binance fills never alter cTrader live equity or trip live risk boundaries. |
| **Maker GTX Execution** | Post-only orders with market fallback | Captures maker rebates (0.02% vs 0.05% taker fees); cancels orders that would cross the spread. |
| **Broker Clamp Guard** | Minimum stop-pip distance & effective R:R gate | Rejects trade setups whose planned risk:reward is crushed by broker-enforced minimum stops. |
